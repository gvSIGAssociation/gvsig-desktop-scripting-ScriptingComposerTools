ICON FOLDER INDEX
----------------------------------------------
The icon files are broken down by file format. Due to some formats resulting in higher quality results, those are considered the preferred files and are located in the folder titled 'High Quality'. This package should contain the following folders in this hierarchy:

High Quality
    ICNS (Mac)
    ICO (Windows)
    PNG
    TIF
Lower Quality
    BMP
    GIF

Within each of the second-level folders, you'll find 102 further folders, one for each icon and its variations. Depending on the file format, you may find multiple sizes within these folders along with any icon variations that may exist. Please note that ICO and ICNS files contain all applicable sizes within a single file, and that ICNS files do not support the 24x24 icon size.
